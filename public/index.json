[{"title":"Tmux : Terminal Multiplexers","description":"I figured out about tmux from an online article, so I started learning it.","content":"Why to learn Tmux? So, the main and important question to ask is: why use Tmux? If I can do all my work from a single terminal, then why would I even touch it?\nBecause Tmux is a terminal multiplexer ‚Äî it allows you to create several \u0026ldquo;pseudo-terminals\u0026rdquo; from a single terminal. This is very useful for running multiple programs with a single connection, such as when you\u0026rsquo;re remotely connecting to a machine using Secure Shell (SSH).\nInstalling Tmux üöÄ The first step is to install it on your machine, because without it, you obviously can‚Äôt use it.\nForLinux Debian Based Install it with apt package manager.\nsudo apt install tmux Arch Linux Install it with pacman package manager simply.\npacman -S tmux For Fedora Install it with dnf.\ndnf install tmux For RHEL or CentOS Install it with yum.\nyum install tmux For MacOs Just use the homebrew package manager to install it. (recommended way)\nbrew install tmux For Windows Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no official package available for Windows. However, you can install it using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow the Linux guide.\nBasic Concepts of Tmux üõ∞Ô∏è Before really starting to use tmux one must understand the basic things that are important to control tmux.\nSome Keywords to memorize Keyword Description / Use Case Session A Tmux session is like a workspace. You can create multiple sessions and switch between them. Useful for managing different projects or tasks. Window Each session can have multiple windows (like tabs). A window typically runs one shell or program. Pane A window can be split into multiple panes. Each pane is like a mini-terminal within the window. Great for multitasking or monitoring multiple processes. Status Bar The status bar is the line at the bottom of the Tmux interface. It shows info like session name, windows, time, and can be customized with plugins or scripts. Let\u0026rsquo;s Use Tmux After successfully installing tmux open your terminal and type\ntmux This will start a new tmux session without a special name. To start a tmux session with a name of your choice you can use the -s flag.\ntmux new -s desired_name This will open a session in your terminal. You can see your session name at the bottom of your session. This bottom bar is known as the Status Bar.\nLike in the photo above, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see something similar.\nKey Bindings to remember For controlling panes Key Binding Use Case Ctrl + B + % To create a pane horizotally within the window of the session. Ctrl + B + \u0026quot; To create a pane vertically within the window of the session. Ctrl + B + ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏è To navigate among the panes.
